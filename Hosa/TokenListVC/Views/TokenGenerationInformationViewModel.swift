            <p>A token is a key to enter the app. For other people to have access to Hosa's features, you first need a code for them. With this code, other people can:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>See a live stream of the place watched by the camera.</li>
             <li>Control the system</li>

            <p>The person for whom you sent the token may have access to one, two, or all the three features, depending on what you choose to allow in the next step! </p>
